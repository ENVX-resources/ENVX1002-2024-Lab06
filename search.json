    "text": "Exercise 1: barley (walk-through)\n\nBackground\nAn experiment was designed to compare two varieties of spring barley. Thirty four plots were used, seventeen being randomly allocated to variety A and seventeen to variety B. Unfortunately five plots were destroyed. The yields (t/ha) from the remaining plots were as they appear in the file Barley.csv.\n\n\nInstructions\nFirst, quickly explore the data; then, utilise the HATPC process and test the hypothesis that the two varieties give equal yields, assuming that the samples are independent.\n\n\nHATPC:\n\nHypothesis\nAssumptions\nTest (statistic)\nP-value\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel of significance\n\n\n\nThe level of significance is usually set at 0.05. This value is generally accepted in the scientific community and is also linked to Type 2 errors, where choosing a lower significance increases the likelihood of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.\n\n\n\n\nData exploration\nFirst we load the data and inspect its structure to see if it needs to be cleaned or transformed. The glimpse() function is a tidy version of str() that provides a quick overview of the data that focuses on the variables, ignoring data attributes.\n\n\nTry to compare str() and glimpse() to see what the differences are.\n\nbarley &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"barley.csv\")\ndplyr::glimpse(barley)\n\nRows: 29\nColumns: 2\n$ Variety &lt;chr&gt; \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A…\n$ Yield   &lt;dbl&gt; 4.6, 4.3, 3.8, 3.4, 3.9, 3.9, 3.9, 4.4, 3.6, 3.6, 4.7, 3.9, 3.…\n\n\nThe Variety column is a factor with two levels, A and B, but it is defined as a character. We can convert it to a factor using the mutate() function from the dplyr package, but it is not necessary for the t-test since R will automatically convert it to a factor.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nbarley &lt;- mutate(barley, Variety = as.factor(Variety))\n\nQuickly preview the data as a plot to see if there are any trends or unusual observations.\n\nbarley %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Variety, y = Yield)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA trained eye will anticipate that the data may not meet the assumption of equal variance; however, we will test this assumption later. Otherwise, there appear to be no unusual observations in the data.\n\n\nHypothesis\nWhat are the null and alternative hypotheses? We can use the following notation:\nH_0: \\mu_A = \\mu_B H_1: \\mu_A \\neq \\mu_B\nwhere \\mu_A and \\mu_B are the population means of varieties A and B, respectively.\n\n\nIt is important that when using mathematical symbols to denote the null and alternative hypotheses, you should always define what the symbols mean. Otherwise, the reader may not understand what you are referring to.\nThe equations above are written in \\LaTeX, a typesetting system that is commonly used in scientific writing. You can learn more about \\LaTeX here. The raw syntax used to write the equations are shown below:\n$$H_0: \\mu_A = \\mu_B$$\n$$H_1: \\mu_A \\neq \\mu_B$$\nWhy do we always define the null and alternative hypotheses? In complex research projects or when working in a team, it is important to ensure that everyone is on the same page. By defining the hypotheses, you can avoid misunderstandings and ensure that everyone is working towards the same goal as the mathematical notation is clear and unambiguous.\n\n\nAssumptions\n\nNormality\nThere are many ways to check for normality. Here we will use the QQ-plot. Use of ggplot2 is preferred (as a means of practice) but since we are just exploring data, base R functions are not a problem to use.\n\nUsing ggplot2Using base R\n\n\n\nggplot(barley, aes(sample = Yield)) +\n  stat_qq() +\n  stat_qq_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Variety)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\nqqnorm(barley$Yield[barley$Variety == \"A\"], main = \"Variety A\")\nqqline(barley$Yield[barley$Variety == \"A\"])\nqqnorm(barley$Yield[barley$Variety == \"B\"], main = \"Variety B\")\nqqline(barley$Yield[barley$Variety == \"B\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Do the plots indicate the data are normally distributed?\nAnswer: Yes, the data appear to be normally distributed as the QQ-plot shows that the data points are close to the line.\n\n\nHomogeneity of variance\nFrom the boxplot, we can see that there is some indication that the variances are not equal. We can test this assumption using Bartlett’s test or Levene’s test; here we will just use Bartlett’s test.\n\nbartlett.test(Yield ~ Variety, data = barley)\n\n\n    Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances\n\ndata:  Yield by Variety\nBartlett's K-squared = 14.616, df = 1, p-value = 0.0001318\n\n\nQuestion: Does the Bartlett’s test indicate the two groups have equal variances? What effect will that have on the analysis?\nAnswer: The two groups have unequal variance (Bartlett’s test: X^2 = 14.6, p &lt; 0.01). This means that we will need to use the Welch’s t-test, which does not assume equal variances.\n\n\n\nTest statistic\nWe can now calculate the test statistic using the t.test() function in R. Since the variances are unequal, we do not have to specify the var.equal argument – the default test for t.test() is the Welch’s t-test which does not assume equal variances.\n\nt.test(Yield ~ Variety, data = barley)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  Yield by Variety\nt = -4.9994, df = 19.441, p-value = 7.458e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group A and group B is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.9293569 -0.3814274\nsample estimates:\nmean in group A mean in group B \n       4.052941        4.708333 \n\n\n\n\nP-value\nSince the p-value is &lt; 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis that the mean yield of both varieties is equal.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe conclusion needs to be brought into the context of the study. In a scientific report or paper, you would write something like this:\n\nThe mean yield of barley variety A was significantly different from that of variety B (t = -5.0, df = 19.4, p &lt; 0.01)."

One plant of each pair was chosen randomly and treated; the other was left as a control. The increases in height (in centimetres) of plants over a two-week period are given in the file Two week plant heights. We wish to compare whether the treatment is actually inducing improved growth, as compared to the control.\n\n\nInstructions\nHere, we have two samples, and the samples are paired as it is a before-after experiment. So we’d like to conduct a paired t-test.\nFor paired t-tests the analysis is performed as a 1-sample t-test on the difference between each pair so the only assumption is the normality assumption.\nCopy the structure below and perform your analysis in your document.\n## Exercise 2: plant growth\n### Data exploration\n### Hypothesis\n### Assumptions\n#### Normality\n#### Homogeneity of variance\n### Test statistic\n### P-value\n### Conclusion\nNote that the data is not tidy.

To check on its success, a number of water samples were taken at random times and locations in the weeks before and after the process was installed. The following are the turbidity values (units = NTU) of the water samples.\n\n\nInstructions\nNow we consider further examples of a two-sample t-test, but where the assumption of equal variance and normality may not be met for the raw data. Sometimes after applying a data transformation the analysis can proceed assuming equal variances – but always check after a data transformation.\nThe data can be read with the code below:\nturbidity &lt;-read_csv(\"Turbidity.csv\")\nFor data transformation, you may need to create a new variable in your dataset to store the transformed data. For example, to create a new variable TurbLog10 that stores the log10 transformed turbidity values, you can use the following code:\nturbidity$TurbLog10 &lt;- log10(turbidity$Turbidity)\nTo interpret the results for your conclusions, you may need to back-transform the mean and/or confidence interval values. To back transform log10 data you use:\n10^{\\text{mean or CI}}\nTo back-transform natural log, loge, you use:\ne^{\\text{mean or CI}}"
